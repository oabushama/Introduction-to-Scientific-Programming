\Level 0 {Auto}

This is not actually obscure, but it intersects many other topics, so
we put it here for now.

\Level 1 {Declarations}

Sometimes the type of a variable is obvious:
\begin{lstlisting}
std::vector< std::shared_ptr< myclass >>*
  myvar = new std::vector< std::shared_ptr< myclass >>
                ( 20, new myclass(1.3) );
\end{lstlisting}
(Pointer to vector of 20 shared pointers to \n{myclass}, initialized
with unique instances.)  You can write this as:
\begin{lstlisting}
auto myvar =
  new std::vector< std::shared_ptr< myclass >>
            ( 20, new myclass(1.3) );
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{slide}{Type deduction}
  \label{sl:auto-deduct}
In:
\begin{lstlisting}
std::vector< std::shared_ptr< myclass >>*
  myvar = new std::vector< std::shared_ptr< myclass >>
                ( 20, new myclass(1.3) );
\end{lstlisting}
the compiler can figure it out:
\begin{lstlisting}
auto myvar =
  new std::vector< std::shared_ptr< myclass >>
            ( 20, new myclass(1.3) );
auto result = someobject.somemethod();
\end{lstlisting}
\end{slide}

// class method:
  some_object &get_some_object() { return my_object; };
// main program:
auto object_copy  = thing.get_some_object();
auto &object_mutable  = thing.get_some_object();
const auto &object_immutable  = thing.get_some_object();
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{block}
\end{comment}

\Level 1 {Iterating}

\begin{block}{Auto iterators}
  \label{sl:auto-iterator}
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{lstlisting}
      vector<int> myvector(20);
      for ( auto copy_of_int : myvector )
      s += copy_of_int;
      for ( auto &ref_to_int : myvector )
      ref_to_int = s;
    \end{lstlisting}
    is actually short for:
    \begin{lstlisting}
      for ( std::iterator it=myvector.begin() ;
      it!=myvector.end() ; ++it )
      s += *it ; // note the deref
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{multicols}
  Range iterators Can be used with anything that is iteratable\\
  (vector, map, your own classes!)
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Other iterator uses}
  \label{sl:reverse-iterator}
  Reverse iteration can not be done with range-based syntax.
  
  Use general syntax with reverse iterator: \indextermtt{rbegin},
  \indextermtt{rend}.

  Also:
  \begin{lstlisting}
    auto first = myarray.begin();
    first += 2;
    auto last  = myarray.end();
    last  -= 2-;
    myarray.erase(first,last);
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{block}

%% \Level 0 {RAII}
%% \label{sec:raii}

%% The concept of \indextermdef{RAII} is fairly elementary

\ref{sec:stack-heap}

\Level 0 {Iterating over classes}
\label{sec:range-iter}

You know that you can iterate over \n{vector} objects:
\begin{lstlisting}
vector<int> myvector(20);
for ( auto copy_of_int : myvector )
  s += copy_of_int;
for ( auto &ref_to_int : myvector )
  ref_to_int = s;
\end{lstlisting}
(Many other \ac{STL} classes are iteratable like this.)

This is not magic: it is possible to iterate over any class:
a \emph{class} is 
\emph{iteratable}\index{class!iteratable} that has a number of conditions satisfied.

The class needs to have:
\begin{itemize}
\item a method \indextermtt{begin} with prototype
\begin{lstlisting}
iteratableClass iteratableClass::begin()
\end{lstlisting}
That gives an
  object in the initial state, which we will call the `iterator object'; likewise
\item a method \indextermtt{end}
\begin{lstlisting}
iteratableClass iteratableClass::end()} 
\end{lstlisting}
that gives an 
  object in the final state; furthermore you need
\item an increment operator
\begin{lstlisting}
void iteratableClass::operator++()
\end{lstlisting}
that
  advances the iterator object to the next state;
\item a test
\begin{lstlisting}
bool iteratableClass::operator!=(const iteratableClass&)
\end{lstlisting}
to determine
  whether the iteration can continue; finally
\item a dereference operator 
\begin{lstlisting}
iteratableClass::operator*()
\end{lstlisting}
that takes the
  iterator object and returns its state.
\end{itemize}

\begin{slide}{Requirements}
  \label{sl:rangemethods}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a method \n{iteratable iteratable::begin()}: initial state
  \item a method \n{iteratable iteratable::end()}:  final state
  \item an increment operator \n{void iteratable::operator++}: advance
  \item a test \n{bool iteratable::operator!=(const iteratable&)}
  \item a dereference operator \n{iteratable::operator*}: return state
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{block}{Simple illustration}
  \label{sl:bagdata}
  
  Let's make a class, called a \n{bag}, that models a set of integers,
  and we want to enumerate them. For simplicity sake we will make a set
  of contiguous integers:
  %
  \verbatimsnippet{bagdata}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Internal state}
  \label{sl:bagseek}
  When you create an iterator object it will be copy of the object you
  are iterating over, except that it remembers how far it has
  searched:
  %
  \verbatimsnippet{bagseek}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Initial/final state}
  \label{sl:bagbeginend}
  The \n{begin} method gives a \n{bag} with the seek parameter
  initialized:
  %
  \verbatimsnippet{bagbeginend}
  %
  These routines are public because they are (implicitly) called by the
  client code.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Termination test}
  \label{sl:bagtest}
  The termination test method is called on the iterator, comparing it to
  the \n{end} object:
  %
  \verbatimsnippet{bagtest}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Dereference}
  \label{sl:bagderef}
  Finally, we need the increment method and the dereference. Both access
  the \n{seek} member:
  %
  \verbatimsnippet{bagderef}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Use case}
  \label{sl:bagfind}

  We can iterate over our own class:
  %
  \snippetwithoutput{bagfinditer}{loop}{bagfind}
\end{block}

If we add a method \n{has} to the class:
%
\verbatimsnippet{baghastest}
%
we can call this:
%
\verbatimsnippet{bagtestcall}
%
Of course, we could have written this function
without the range-based iteration, but this implementation is
particularly elegant.

\begin{exercise}
  You can now do exercise~\ref{ex:primerange}, implementing a prime
  number generator with this mechanism.
\end{exercise}

If you think you understand \n{const}, consider that the \n{has}
method is conceptually \n{cost}. But if you add that keyword, the
compiler will complain about that use of \n{*this}, since it is
altered through the \n{begin} method.

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:rangeconstiter}
  Find a way to make \n{has} a \n{const} method.
\end{exercise}

\Level 0 {Lambdas}
\label{sec:lambda}
\input lambda

\Level 0 {Casts}
\label{sec:cast}

In C++, constants and variables have clear types. For cases where you
want to force the type to be something else, there is the
\indextermdef{cast} mechanism. With a cast you tell the compiler:
treat this thing as such-and-such a type, no matter how it was
defined.

In C, there was only one casting mechanism:
\begin{lstlisting}
sometype x;
othertype y = (othertype)x;
\end{lstlisting}
This mechanism is still available as the
\indextermtt{reinterpret_cast}, which does `take this byte and pretend
it is the following type':
\begin{lstlisting}
sometype x;
auto y = reinterpret_cast<othertype>(x);
\end{lstlisting}

The inheritance mechanism necessitates another casting mechanism.
An object from a derived class contains in it all the information of
the base class. It is easy enough to take a pointer to the derived
class, the bigger object, and cast it to a pointer to the base object.
The other way is harder.

Consider:
\begin{lstlisting}
class Base {};
class Derived : public Base {};
Base *dobject = new Derived;
\end{lstlisting}
Can we now cast dobject to a pointer-to-derived ?
\begin{itemize}
\item \indextermtt{static_cast} assumes that you know what you are
  doing, and it moves the pointer regardless.
\item \indextermtt{dynamic_cast} checks whether \n{dobject} was
  actually of class \n{Derived} before it moves the pointer, and
  returns \indextermtt{nullptr} otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
  One further problem with the C-style casts is that their syntax is
  hard to spot, for instance by searching in an editor.
  Because C++ casts have a unique keyword, they are easily recognized.
\end{remark}

\begin{slide}{C++ casts}
  \label{sl:cpp-casts}
  Old-style `take this byte and pretend it is XYZ':
  \n{reinterpret_cast}
  
  Casting with classes:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \n{static_cast} cast base to derived without check.
  \item \n{dynamic_cast} cast base to derived with check.
  \end{itemize}
  Adding/removing const: \n{const_cast}

  Syntactically clearly recognizable.
\end{slide}

\Level 1 {Static cast}

One use of casting is to convert to constants to a `larger' type. For
instance, allocation does not use integers but \indextermtt{size_t}.

\verbatimsnippet{longintcast}

However, if the
conversion is possible, the result may still not be `correct'.
%
\snippetwithoutput{longcast}{cast}{intlong}
%
There are no runtime tests on static casting.

Static casts are a good way of casting back void pointers to what they
were originally.

\begin{slide}{Const cast}
  \label{sl:const-cast}
  \verbatimsnippet{longintcast}
  \snippetwithoutput{longcast}{cast}{intlong}  
\end{slide}

\Level 1 {Dynamic cast}

Consider the case where we have a base class and derived classes.
%
\verbatimsnippet{polybase}
%
Also suppose that we have a function that takes a pointer to the base
class:
%
\verbatimsnippet{polymain}
%
The function can discover what derived class the base pointer refers
to:
%
\verbatimsnippet{polycast}

\begin{slide}{Pointer to base class}
  \label{sl:dyn-base-ptr}

  Class and derived:
  %
  \verbatimsnippet{polybase}
\end{slide}

If we have a pointer to a derived object, stored in a pointer to a
base class object, it's possible to turn it safely into a derived
pointer again:
%
\snippetwithoutput{polycast}{cast}{deriveright}

On the other hand, a \indextermtt{static_cast} would not do the job:
%
\snippetwithoutput{polywrong}{cast}{derivewrong}

\begin{slide}{Cast to derived class}
  \label{sl:dyn-cast}
  This is how to do it:
  %
  \snippetwithoutput{polycast}{cast}{deriveright}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Cast to derived class, the wrong way}
  \label{sl:dyn-cast-wrong}
  Do not use this function \n{g}:
  %
  \snippetwithoutput{polywrong}{cast}{derivewrong}
\end{slide}

Note: the base class needs to be polymorphic, meaning that that pure
virtual method is needed. This is not the case with a static cast,
but, as said, this does not work correctly in this case.

\Level 1 {Const cast}

With \indextermtt{const_cast} you can add or remove const from a
variable. This is the only cast that can do this.

\Level 1 {A word about void pointers}

A traditional use for casts in~C was the treatment of
\indextermsub{void}{pointer}s. The need for this is not as severe in
C++ as it was before.

A typical use of void pointers appears in the
PETSc~\cite{petsc-efficient,petsc-home-page} library. Normally when
you call a library routine, you have no further access to what happens
inside that routine. However, PETSc has the functionality for you to
specify a monitor so that you can print out internal quantities.
\begin{lstlisting}
int KSPSetMonitor(KSP ksp,
  int (*monitor)(KSP,int,PetscReal,void*),
  void *context,
  // one parameter omitted
  );
\end{lstlisting}
Here you can declare your own monitor routine that will be called
internally: the library makes a \indexterm{call-back} to your code.
Since the library can not predict whether your monitor routine may
need further information in order to function, there is the
\n{context} argument, where you can pass a structure as void pointer.

This mechanism is no longer needed in C++ where you would use a
\indexterm{lambda} (section~\ref{sec:lambda}):
\begin{lstlisting}
KSPSetMonitor( ksp,
  [mycontext] (KSP k,int ,PetscReal r) -> int {
    my_monitor_function(k,r,mycontext); } );
\end{lstlisting}


\Level 0 {lvalue vs rvalue}
\label{sec:lrvalue}

The terms `lvalue' and `rvalue' sometimes appear in compiler error
messages.
\begin{lstlisting}
int foo() {return 2;}

int main()
{
    foo() = 2;

    return 0;
}

# gives:
test.c: In function 'main':
test.c:8:5: error: lvalue required as left operand of assignment
\end{lstlisting}

See the `lvalue' and `left operand'? To first order of approximation
you're forgiven for thinking that an \indextermdef{lvalue} is something
on the left side of an assignment. The name actually means `locator
value': something that's associated with a specific location in
memory. Thus an lvalue is, also loosely, something that can be modified.

An \indextermdef{rvalue} is then something that appears on the right
side of an assignment, but is really defined as everything that's not
an lvalue. Typically, rvalues can not be modified.

The assignment \n{x=1} is legal because a variable \n{x} is at some specific
location in memory, so it can be assigned to. On the other hand,
\n{x+1=1} is not legal, since \n{x+1} is at best a temporary,
therefore not at a specific memory location, and thus not an lvalue.

Less trivial examples:
\begin{lstlisting}
int foo() { x = 1; return x; }
int main() {
  foo() = 2;
}
\end{lstlisting}
is not legal because \n{foo} does not return an lvalue. However,
\begin{lstlisting}
class foo {
private:
  int x;
public:
  int &xfoo() { return x; };
};
int main() {
  foo x;
  x.xfoo() = 2;
\end{lstlisting}
is legal because the function \n{xfoo} returns a reference to the
non-temporary variable \n{x} of the \n{foo} object.

Not every lvalue can be assigned to: in
\begin{lstlisting}
const int a = 2;
\end{lstlisting}
the variable \n{a} is an lvalue, but can not appear on the left hand
side of an assignment.

\Level 1 {Conversion}

Most lvalues can quickly be converted to rvalues:
\begin{lstlisting}
int a = 1;
int b = a+1;
\end{lstlisting}
Here \n{a} first functions as lvalue, but becomes an rvalue in the
second line.

The ampersand operator takes an lvalue and gives an rvalue:
\begin{lstlisting}
int i;
int *a = &i;
&i = 5; // wrong
\end{lstlisting}

\Level 1 {References}

The ampersand operator yields a reference. It needs to be assigned
from an lvalue, so
\begin{lstlisting}
std::string &s = std::string(); // wrong
\end{lstlisting}
is illegal. The type of \n{s} is an `lvalue reference' and it can not
be assigned from an rvalue.

On the other hand
\begin{lstlisting}
const std::string &s = std::string();
\end{lstlisting}
works, since \n{s} can not be modified any further.

\Level 1 {Rvalue references}
\label{sec:rvalue-ref}

A new feature of C++ is
intended to minimize the amount of data copying through
\indexterm{move semantics}.

Consider a copy assignment operator
\begin{lstlisting}
BigThing& operator=( const BigThing &other ) {
  BigThing tmp(other); // standard copy
  std::swap( /* tmp data into my data */ );
  return *this;
};
\end{lstlisting}
This calls a copy constructor and a destructor on \n{tmp}. (The use of
a temporary makes this safe under exceptions. The \indextermtt{swap}
method never throws an exception, so there is no danger of half-copied
memory.)

However, if you assign
\begin{lstlisting}
thing = BigThing(stuff);
\end{lstlisting}
Now a constructor and destructor is called for the temporary rvalue object on
the right-hand side.

Using a syntax that is new in \indexterm{C++}, we create an
\indextermbus{rvalue}{reference}:
\begin{lstlisting}
BigThing& operator=( BigThing &&other ) {
  swap( /* other into me */ );
  return *this;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\Level 0 {Move semantics}

With an
\emph{overloaded operator}\index{operator!overloading!and copies},
such as addition,
on matrices (or any other big object):
\begin{lstlisting}
Matrix operator+(Matrix &a,Matrix &b);
\end{lstlisting}
the actual addition will involve a copy:
\begin{lstlisting}
Matrix c = a+b;
\end{lstlisting}

Use a move constructor:
\begin{lstlisting}
class Matrix {
private:
  Representation rep;
public:
  Matrix(Matrix &&a) {
    rep = a.rep;
    a.rep = {};
  }
};
\end{lstlisting}

\Level 0 {Graphics}

C++ has no built-in graphics facilities, so you have to use external
libraries such as \indexterm{OpenFrameworks},
\url{https://openframeworks.cc}.
