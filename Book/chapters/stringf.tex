\Level 0 {String denotations}

A string can be enclosed in single or double quotes. That makes it
easier to have the other type in the string.

\Level 0 {Strings}

The \indextermfort{len} function gives the length of the string as
it was allocated, not how much non-blank content you put in it.

To get the more intuitive length of a string, that is, the location of
the last non-blank character, you need to \indextermfort{trim} the string.

Intrinsic functions: \indextermfort{LEN}\n{(string)},
\indextermfort{INDEX}\n{(substring,string)},
\indextermfort{CHAR}\n{(int)}, \indextermfort{ICHAR}\n{(char)},
\indextermfort{TRIM}\n{(string)}
